Absolute partial radiative widths have been obtained with the 35 keV s-wave resonance in aluminium as a reference standard. Strong single particle effects were observed in the final state correlation. These cannot be accounted for by the valence model of neutron capture. A different single particle mechanism must therefore occur at these energies.}

The experimental results for nuclei between H and Bi were critically surveyed, renormalized to selected standard cross sections, and condensed into a set of recommended Maxwellian averaged cross sections for a thermal energy of kT=30 keV. Recent statistical model calculations of the capture cross sections made with the code NON-SMOKER are listed for comparison; these calculated cross sections are adopted in those cases where experimental information is still missing, e.g., for the majority of radioactive nuclei defining the s-process branchings. Maxwellian averages, normalized to our recommended 30 keV averages, were determined for a range of thermal energies between kT=5 and 100 keV. We have also included the calculated stellar enhancement factors due to thermally populated nuclear states as a function of temperature.}

abstract = {We determined interstellar cosmic ray exposure ages of 40 large presolar silicon carbide grains extracted from the Murchison CM2 meteorite. Our ages, based on cosmogenic Ne-21, range from 3.9 ± 1.6 Ma to ∼3 ± 2 Ga before the start of the Solar System ∼4.6 Ga ago. A majority of the grains have interstellar lifetimes of \&lt;300 Ma, which is shorter than theoretical estimates for large grains. These grains condensed in outflows of asymptotic giant branch stars \&lt;4.9 Ga ago that possibly formed during an episode of enhanced star formation ∼7 Ga ago. A minority of the grains have ages \&gt;1 Ga. Longer lifetimes are expected for large grains. We determined that at least 12 of the analyzed grains were parts of aggregates in the interstellar medium: The large difference in nuclear recoil loss of cosmic ray spallation products 3He and 21Ne enabled us to estimate that the irradiated objects in the interstellar medium were up to 30 times larger than the analyzed grains. Furthermore, we estimate that the majority of the grains acquired the bulk of their cosmogenic nuclides in the interstellar medium and not by exposure to an enhanced particle flux of the early active sun.}}

title = {Constraints on Heterogeneous Galactic Chemical Evolution from Meteoritic Stardust},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {Meteorites contain presolar grains that formed in stars prior to solar system formation and preserve a record of stellar and galactic evolutionary processes. We consider a stochastic model of heterogeneous mixing of supernova ejecta into a homogeneous interstellar medium (ISM), first presented by Lugaro et al. The predictions of the model for Si, Ti, and O isotopic ratios are compared with the compositions of presolar SiC, Al2O3, and MgAl2O4 grains. Model parameters that reproduce the range of Si isotopic ratios in SiC grains fail to reproduce the strong observed correlation between SiC Si and Ti isotopic ratios and the range of 18O/16O ratios in the oxide phases. The Si-Ti correlation in SiC implies that heterogeneous mixing of SNe ejecta can account for at most 40\% of the range of grain isotopic compositions. This result further implies that the ejecta from diverse SNe are well mixed to the percent level in the ISM, consistent with recent results based on stellar and interstellar abundance measurements. However, the presolar grain data provide much more stringent limits on the range of relative element ratios (e.g., Mg/Fe) than can be derived from astronomical observations. The large scatter in metallicity observed for disk stars of a given age cannot be explained by heterogeneous mixing of stellar ejecta. The range of 18O/16O ratios measured in presolar oxide grains implies either that they formed in stars with a wider range of metallicities than the SiC progenitor stars or that their parent stars experienced moderate amounts of cool bottom processing.}
